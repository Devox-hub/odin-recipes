        <p class="description">Tempura is a classic Japanese dish known for its light and crispy texture. It consists of seafood or vegetables coated in a delicate batter and deep-fried until golden brown. This recipe will guide you through making perfect tempura at home, just like Inosuke from Demon Slayer loves!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients (2-3 people)</h2>
        <h3>Tempura batter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour (or tempura flour)</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) ice-cold water</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Frying</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10-12 large shrimp (or vegetables like sweet potato, zucchini, mushrooms)</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dipping sauce (Tentsuyu - optional):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup dashi (or water + ½ tsp dashi powder)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin (sweet rice wine)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If using shrimp, peel and devein them, leaving the tail on. Make small cuts on the belly side to prevent curling.</li>
            <li>Slice vegetables into thin pieces.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, lightly beat the egg, then add ice-cold water.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking powder, then mix gently. Do not overmix—lumps are okay! Keeping the batter cold helps create a crisp texture.</li>
            <li>In a deep pan or pot, heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). Test by dropping a bit of batter—if it sizzles and floats, it’s ready.</li>
            <li>Lightly coat shrimp and vegetables in flour, then dip into the batter.</li>
            <li>Carefully place them in the hot oil. Fry for about 2 minutes for shrimp and 3-4 minutes for vegetables.</li>
            <li>Remove and drain on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, combine dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. Heat until warm.</li>
            <li>Serve the crispy tempura with the dipping sauce and enjoy it while hot!</li>
        </ol>
